# Design Proof demo fixtures

## Scope

- `fixtures/generic-app/` — deliberately bland demo input (not product code)
- `fixtures/reports/capture.json` — committed capture artifact
- `fixtures/reports/dp-report.json` — offline demo fallback
- `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` — attribution separating our work from demo input

## Planted tells (must trigger)

**Genericness:** Inter/system font, violet-pink hero gradient, identical card shadows, monotone 8px radius, acid accent on dark bg, emoji in chrome, centered sections, gray mush

**Drift:** near-duplicate grays, missing focus rings, type scale drift, spacing off 4px grid, state gaps

**Intentional:** brutalist/mono route or flagged section for `intentional` taste verdict

## Regeneration workflow

1. Change fixture UI in `fixtures/generic-app`
2. Run `pnpm dev:fixture` and `pnpm capture:fixture`
3. Run `pnpm diagnose:fixture` if full report must update
4. Update detector golden tests if expectations shift
5. Commit `capture.json` and `dp-report.json` together

## Demo reliability

- Live capture first; offline artifact always works
- If capture/API fails, web returns committed `dp-report.json` with clear non-live state
- Record backup demo video for reviewer presentation

## Build sprint compliance

- Generic app is labeled demo input in `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`
- Lead demo with capture → diagnose → art-direct → reconcile loop, not KPI cards
- Public repo; only in-event work presented as original contribution

## DoD

- ≥8 planted findings on fixture (4 tells + 4 drifts minimum)
- Offline report loads when live path fails
- Fixture remains intentionally bland
